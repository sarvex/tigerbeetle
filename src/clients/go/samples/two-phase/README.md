# Two-Phase Transfer Go Sample

This project creates two accounts (`1` and `2`) and begins a
pending transfer of `500` of an amount from account `1` to
account `2`.

Then it checks that **account `1`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 0`
 * `credits_posted = 0`
 * `debits_pending = 500` and
 * `credits_pending = 0`
And that **account `2`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 0`
 * `credits_posted = 0`
 * `debits_pending = 0` and
 *`credits_pending = 500`
 This is because a pending
transfer only affects pending credits and debits on accounts,
not posted credits and debits.

Then it creates a second transfer that marks the first
transfer as posted. It then fetches both transfers, validates
that the two transfers exist, validates that the first
transfer had (and still has) a `pending` flag, and validates
that the second transfer had (and still has) a
`post_pending_transfer` flag.

Finally, it fetches both accounts, validates they both exist,
and checks that credits and debits for both account are now
*posted*, not pending.

Specifically, that **account `1`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 500`
 * `credits_posted = 0`
 * `debits_pending = 0` and
 * `credits_pending = 0`
And that account `2` has:
 * `debits_posted = 0`
 * `credits_posted = 500`
 * `debits_pending = 0` and
 * `credits_pending = 0`
