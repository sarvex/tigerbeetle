# Basic Go Sample

This project creates two accounts (`1` and `2`) and
transfers `10` of an amount from account `1` to
account `2`.

Then it fetches both accounts, checks they both exist, and
checks that **account `1`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 10`
 * and `credits_posted = 0`

And that **account `2`** has:
 * `debits_posted= 0`
 * and `credits_posted = 10`

## Prerequisites

Linux >= 5.6 is the only production environment we
support. But for ease of development we also support macOS and Windows.
* Go >= 1.17

## Setup

Run:

```console
$ go mod init tbtest
$ go mod tidy
```
