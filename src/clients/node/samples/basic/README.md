# Basic Node.js Sample

This project creates two accounts (`1` and `2`) and
transfers `10` of an amount from account `1` to
account `2`.

Then it fetches both accounts, checks they both exist, and
checks that **account `1`** has:
 * `debits_posted = 10` and
 * `credits_posted = 0`

And that **account `2`** has:
 * `debits_posted= 0` and
 * `credits_posted = 10`

## Prerequisites

Linux >= 5.6 is the only production environment we
support. But for ease of development we also support macOS.
* NodeJS >= `14`

## Setup

Run:

```console
$ npm install tigerbeetle-node
```
