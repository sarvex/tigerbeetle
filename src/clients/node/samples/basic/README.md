# Basic Node.js Sample

This project creates two accounts (`1` and `2`) and
transfers `10` of an amount from account `1` to
account `2`.

It then fetches both accounts, checks they both exist, and
checks that account `1` has `debits_posted = 10`,
`credits_posted = 0`; and that account `2` has `debits_posted
= 0`, `credits_posted = 10`.

### Prerequisites

Linux >= 5.6 is the only production environment we
support. But for ease of development we also support macOS.
* NodeJS >= `14`

## Setup

Run:

```console
$ npm install tigerbeetle-node
```
